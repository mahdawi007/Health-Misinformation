I don’t need to have my cholesterol checked until I’m middle-aged. The American Heart Association 
recommends you start getting your cholesterol checked every 5 years starting at age 20. It’s a good idea to start
having a cholesterol test even earlier if your family has a history of heart disease. Children in these families 
can have high cholesterol levels, putting them at increased risk for developing heart disease as adults. You can 
help yourself and your family by eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly.
